# Game_Jam_2D

This is a simple game, the objective is to shoot the targets that spawn every 3 seconds. 
If you hit 10 targets, the spawn rate becomes progressively faster, as does the difficulty.
Everything is simple but functional, with an easy-to-use UI for the score, the ammo count, and the timer.

I used two singleton classes, UIManager and GameManager, to manage the UI and the game loop, respectively.
